        <h3>The Questions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                What was your first impression of this site?
                <p>I thought that the site was empty and had almost too much white space.</p>
            </li>
            

            <li>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)
                <p>Each link on the top led to short information of the pastry. When you click on the pink box on the top right, then it has links on the sides. No color schemes, and photos of different sizes.  </p>
            </li>

            <li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?
                <p>It confuses me a bit, because it has basic information on the top tabs, but upon clicking the pink box then it shows many more items for sale. </p>
            </li>

            <li>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from it? Why?
                <p>The layout between the graphics and text underneath somewhat detract from each other. There is just a line and not an obvious break with a color change to show that more info in underneath.</p>
            </li>

            <li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time reasonable?
                <p>The load time was practically instantaneous and reasonable.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?
                <p>Color and size are readable. The background was just white, it felt like it was lacking substance.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the navigation well done?
                <p>It had a navigation bar, but it only lead to basic information that could also be found in the shop, sabletine online link.</p>
            </li>

            <li>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all the pages?
                <p>It felt blank on all the pages.</p>
            </li>

            <li>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?
                <p>The design was not responsive. Everything kept its size and I had to use a scrollbar on the side and the bottom to be able to see.</p>
            </li>

            <li>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?
                <p>I like the checkout process. It felt professional, even more complete than the rest of the site.</p>
            </li>

        </ol>
